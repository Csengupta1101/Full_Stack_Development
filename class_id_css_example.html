<!-- in here we are using a class selector , where class is getting defined to perform a color selection on certain elements where class 
is mentioned as red-heading -->

<!-- we also used id selector that works similar like class selector -->

<!-- Remember , id selector can only be used in one element in one single html file while class selector can be applied in many elements in a 
file -->
