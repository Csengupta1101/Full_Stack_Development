/* 1 px - 1 pixel - 1/96 inch - 0.26 mm
1 pt - 1 point - 1/72 inch - 0.35 mm
1 pc - 1 pica - 12 points (about 1/6 of an inch) - 1/6 inch
1 em - 1 M - full width of the letter m - m is the most wide letter in english elphabet - 100% of the parent (relative sizing)
1 rem - 100% of the root - (relative sizing) */


/* in the below example of em we are seeing a h1 tag which is a parent tag for a p element , now for the parent tag which is the h1 tag if we set font size as 20 px this means ,and 1 em for 
it's child tag which is the p element will be 100% of the parent tag size which is 20 px , if we change the parent font size to 40 then simaltenously the child tag size will change ,
now if we make the child tag size as 2 em then it's size will automatically change to 80 - (40*2 pixels) , this is relative sizing

similarly with rem tag the changes will happen in relation with the root tag , which generally is the html tag  , based on it all the elements/tags under the root tag size wil change , as we
provide rem value to them.  */
