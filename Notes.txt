While applying colors in css , we have to make sure that the color applied on our html elements follow the rule of prioritiy and the 
inline style elemenmt argument remains as top priority , suppose in a ordered list , there are three items , if on a external css 
we set the colour of ordered list as red , this will ideally apply on all list elements , but suppose in the html , we provide a inline
colour (green) to any single list element , then only that element will turn green and the rest will stay as red.
