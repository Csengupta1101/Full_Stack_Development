<!-- self closing tags are tags that looks similar to closing tags but the forward slash position is different here. Also this tags
do not require opening or closing tags separately. Below is an example where a horizontal  self closing tag is used to draw separation between two 
paragraphs. -->

<p> This is line 1</p>
<hr/>
<p> This is line 2</p>

<!-- another self closing tag is break tags , this is self closing break tags , this helps in line separation within same paragraph -->
